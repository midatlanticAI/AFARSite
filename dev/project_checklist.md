# Project Checklist

## Overall Project Notes
- **Priorities**: Start with Contacts (mostly done) and Jobs (core feature), then Opportunities and Invoices. Reports and integrations (e.g., QuickBooks, Google Maps) can come later.
- **Best Practices**: All implementations will follow your rules (e.g., clear modular code, error handling, async patterns, security for sensitive data, PEP 8 style).
- **Tech Stack**: Backend (FastAPI/MongoDB for CRUD), Frontend (React/MUI for UI/forms/lists).
- **Next Steps**: We can tackle one section at a time. Let me know where to start (e.g., "Implement Job Create/Edit")â€”I'll propose code changes with explanations first.

## 1. Contact Page (Create/Edit View)
[ ] Auto-assign Customer number on create  
[ ] Display full name as "Last Name, First Name" (computed if not provided)  
[ ] First name field  
[ ] Last name field

  - Cell number  
  - Checkbox for "Can receive texts"  
  - Two additional numbers (if available)  
[ ] Email addresses (up to 3): Send messages to all when applicable  
[ ] Service address (with Google Maps for pinpointing location and auto-population via dropdown with address prediction):

[ ] Special Instructions field (textarea)  
[ ] Tax checkbox ("Will this contact be taxed?")  
[ ] Distinguish between person and company contact (toggle/switch)  
[ ] Service location button (for tenant/landlord, property management, etc.): Close-up/street view, auto-population for address fields  
[ ] Add custom tags (chip input with add/remove)  
[ ] Merge contact feature (select another contact to merge into, reassign jobs/invoices)  
[ ] Mark Inactive button  
[ ] Delete contact button (with confirmation dialog to prevent accidents)

- [x] Attach `Idempotency-Key` header automatically on mutating requests.
- [ ] Job Detail page: wire notes, status updates, scheduling, reminders, files.
- [ ] Contact Detail page: wire notes, messages, reminders, opportunities.
- [ ] Billing UI: invoices/payments/refunds lists (read-only first).
- [ ] Snackbar/toast error handling for API failures.

**Progress Notes** (Updated 2025-08-21):
- Optional idempotency enabled; no 400s without key.
- In-memory DB fallback upgraded to support CRUD used by services.
- Frontend attaches Idempotency-Key for mutating requests.
